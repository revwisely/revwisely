In this week’s article, we cover how to know when it’s time, what to fix, and how to do it right.
Pricing is one of the strangest topics in SaaS. Everyone knows it matters, yet most teams avoid touching it for as long as they can. Leaders will spend hours debating product features, messaging, or pipeline strategy. But the moment someone suggests updating pricing, the room suddenly gets very quiet. 





</p></div><p>It makes sense.</p><p>Pricing feels fuzzy and risky. It’s tied to money, emotions, and the fear of breaking something that currently works “well enough.” Most pricing models come from a moment early in a company’s life when decisions had to be made quickly. A few smart people compared competitors, guessed what sounded fair, and moved on. The company grew. The market changed. Customers evolved.</p><p>But the pricing stayed the same.</p><p>The issue isn’t that pricing fails in a dramatic way. It drifts out of alignment slowly. Deals take longer. Discounts get bigger. Reps adjust the model on the fly. Two customers with similar needs end up with very different offers. Then one day you realize: the pricing that once fit your business no longer does.</p><p>This article walks through how to recognize that moment, what usually causes the misalignment, and how to reset pricing without creating chaos for your sales team or customers.</p><h5>Pricing: The Quiet Growth Lever</h5><p>Many people think pricing is a finance problem. In reality, it’s closer to human psychology. Pricing shapes how people see your product, how reps behave, and how customers compare you to other options.</p><p>Small pricing changes can have a big impact. A simple adjustment can shorten sales cycles, reduce discounting, strengthen renewals, and make revenue more predictable. But because pricing issues are quiet at first, companies often ignore the signs.</p><p>One of the biggest signs is the gap between list price and what customers actually pay. When large discounts become the norm, your list price has lost credibility. This doesn’t always mean the price is too high — sometimes it means the model doesn’t match how customers buy or how they understand value.</p><p>Either way, pricing problems are usually problems of alignment. And alignment can be fixed.</p><h5>The Cost of Doing Nothing is Significant</h5><p>Typical SaaS companies lose 1–5% to revenue leakage. Companies with heavy discounting, inconsistent licensing, and “theater” governance likely lose several multiples of that.</p><p>For example, if your company does $50 million in total bookings, then this translates to $1 to $5 million in lost revenue.</p><p>Moreover, this shortfall compounds over time across renewals, expansions, and upgrades, eroding lifetime value (LTV), per-customer ARR, and overall growth capacity. Don’t let any tell you licensing isn’t one of your most important growth drivers-–if not the biggest.</p><h5>How to Know It’s Time to Revisit Pricing</h5><p>Most companies don’t start a pricing reset because they want to. They start one because something feels off. Here are the clearest signals:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Discounts keep getting bigger. </strong>When reps assume every deal needs a steep discount, list prices no longer reflect reality.</li><li><strong>Deals that used to be simple now feel harder. </strong>Buyers ask more questions. They want explanations. More people get involved. Confusion slows everything down.</li><li><strong>Reps start making up their own versions of the pricing. </strong>If the official pricing doesn’t help them win, they’ll create something that does. This is a sign the model is no longer practical.</li><li><strong>Similar customers pay very different amounts. </strong>This doesn’t mean customers are bad negotiators. It means your pricing model leaves too much to interpretation.</li><li><strong>The product keeps improving, but growth feels stuck. </strong>This is one of the most common warning signs. Pricing might be holding you back more than the product itself.</li></ul><p>When you start seeing two or more of these patterns, your pricing isn’t broken — it’s outdated. And outdated pricing eventually becomes a weight on the business.</p><h5>Diagnosing What’s Actually Wrong</h5><p>When teams say, “Our pricing isn’t working,” they usually jump straight to changing the price point. But the price itself is only one part of the system.</p><p>A healthy pricing review looks at four areas:</p><p><strong>Price level<br/></strong>Are your headline numbers aligned with what customers believe is fair? Are they too high or too low? Or is the problem simply the gap between list price and real price?</p><p><strong>Packaging<br/></strong>Do customers understand the differences between your options? Can they move up the ladder as their needs grow? Confusing packaging crushes sales momentum.</p><p><strong>Licensing model<br/></strong>Are you charging for the right unit of value? Seats, usage, outcomes — the best metric is the one that grows as customers succeed, not the one that punishes them for using the product more.</p><p><strong>Governance<br/></strong>Even the best pricing model will fall apart if the rules aren’t clear. When discounting feels random, or every exception gets approved, the system loses structure.</p><p>Most pricing problems come from a mix of these areas, not just one.</p><h5>What a Modern Pricing Refresh Looks Like</h5><p>A good pricing refresh doesn’t feel dramatic. It feels like clarity — like cleaning out a messy garage. You still own the same things, but now everything has a place.</p><p>It usually starts with realigning list prices with the market. This isn’t about raising or lowering everything at once. It’s about making sure the list price and street price make sense together. When the baseline feels fair, reps discount less and sell with more confidence.</p><p>Next, companies simplify how customers buy. This might mean clearer tiers, fewer special rules, or a more natural “good/better/best” structure. Customers don’t want a menu — they want a path.</p><p>Then comes the licensing model. The best models grow as customers get more value. They are easy to understand and don’t create surprise costs.</p><p>Discounting gets cleaned up too. Not cut back — clarified. Strategic discounting is fine. Unpredictable discounting creates problems. Clear guidelines protect fairness and margins.</p><p>Finally, companies tighten up how pricing is used in the field: quoting tools, approvals, exception processes, and those unofficial “workarounds” that reps invent when the system slows them down.</p><p>Together, these changes create a pricing model that feels lighter, easier to sell, and more aligned with how people actually buy.</p><h5>How to Implement Pricing Changes Without Chaos</h5><p>This is the part leaders worry about most. They imagine a wave of customer complaints or a mutiny from sales. But when done well, pricing changes are smoother than most people expect.</p><p>The key is treating pricing as a change-management effort, not a math project. Reps need to understand the “why,” not just the new numbers. When people know the problem you&#x27;re solving — and how the new model helps them — adoption comes much faster.</p><p>Clarity matters too. Share examples. Show how to explain the changes. Give reps simple, honest talking points they can use in real conversations.</p><p>Transitions deserve planning. Decide how renewals will work, what happens with deals already in motion, and whether certain customers are grandfathered. Customers don’t fear new pricing — they fear surprises.</p><p>And at the end, monitor early results. No pricing model is perfect immediately. The goal is progress, not perfection. The best companies update pricing regularly, not once every few years when something breaks.</p><h5>The Takeaway</h5><p>Pricing is one of the strongest growth levers in SaaS, but it’s also one of the easiest to ignore. Because pricing problems don’t explode — they leak. A little lost margin here, a longer sales cycle there, a discount that grows every quarter. Over time, the cost adds up.</p><p>A good pricing refresh doesn’t just increase revenue. It cleans up confusion. It speeds up deals. It builds trust with customers. And it gives your sales team a model they can use without bending it.</p><p>Pricing isn’t about perfection. It’s about alignment. And once it’s aligned, everything else gets easier. </p><p>We have helped many customers refresh pricing to drive more profitable growth.
